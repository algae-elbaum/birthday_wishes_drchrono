# Birthday Wishes
A mini project for my application to drchrono

This project will provide a UI to doctors which will allow them to set up
automatic birthday messages for their patients

Currently being hosted (intermittently) on [gaster.caltech.edu](http://gaster.caltech.edu)

In case it matters to someone reading this, the music server that I put on 
my resume has been changed to be hosted on gaster.caltech.edu:8000/muse_server 
as apache is sad about sharing a port with django, and explicit ports seem to be 
disallowed in the redirect uri for drchrono authentication
