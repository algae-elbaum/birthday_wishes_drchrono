Figure out why accounts are automatically logged out after being redirected to drchrono's auth page
Figure out why accounts are not logged out the very first time logout is called on them

May not address:
Automatically log on after registration
    # Giving authentication issues for some reason
    # For now (and maybe forever) will just redirect to login after registration
Format scopes correctly
    # I'm pretty confused by this one. Does fetching the patients require more
      than listing patients in the scope field?
